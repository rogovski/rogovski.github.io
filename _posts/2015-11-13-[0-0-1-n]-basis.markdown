We'll start with a textbook definition of a basis:

A **basis** (for a nontrivial subspace $H$ of a vector space $V$) is an
indexed set $\mathcal{B} = \\{ v_1, ..., v_p \\}$ in $V$ such that:

1. $\mathcal{B}$ is a linearly independant set
2. $H = Span \\{ v_1, ..., v_p \\}$

It should also be noted that any vector space $V$ is a subspace of itself, therefore,
in the above definition, we can replace $H$ with $V$.

This definition is appropriate because of its rigor. But how can we strengthen
our intuition about what a basis *is*.

def: polynomial - an expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) 
and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents.

def: Degree of a Polynomial - the largest exponent of the polynomial

def: Turning Point - A point at which a graph changes directions. 
This happens at a peak or valley.

prop: If $n$ is the degree of a polynomial, then the polynomial can 
have <em>at most</em> $n - 1$ turning points

def: x-intecepts / zeros of a polynomial - the point(s) where
a graph touches the x axis

prop: If $r$ is a zero of the graph of a polynomial, 
then $x - r$ is a factor of that polynomial

def: Multiplicity - given a polynomial in factored form, Multiplicity is
the power of each factored piece.


example:

construct a polynomial of degree three whose zeros are $-2,0,2$.
We are given three zeros, so we can form three factors.

<p>
$$
y = (x - (-2))(x - 0)(x - 2)
$$
</p>

If we use multiplication to expand this expression in the usual
way, we get

<p>
$$
y = x^3 - 4x
$$
</p>


<p>
$$
\{ \mathbf{x_i}, y_i \}

\qquad where \qquad

i = 1 ... L, \quad
y_i \in \{-1,1\}, \quad
\mathbf{x} \in \mathfrak{R}^D
$$
